# transfer-learning
Project on Transfer Learning for Natural Computation Methods for Machine Learning course(1DL073)

The main objective of our work is to understand how and why transfer learning works. We conduct a set of experiments similar to the ones performed in the paper [***"How transferable are features in deep neural networks?"***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792) In our work, we have replicated the experiments in PyTorch and used different datasets and model architecture.

## Data Preparation
- We used Cats Vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle. Download the dataset from this link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/biaiscience/dogs-vs-cats).
- Run `python prepare_dataset.py` from the directory which has the downloaded dataset. This creates the datset in required strutcure for analysis.
- To run in Google Colab: Compress this dataset as a zip file and upload this in Google Drive 

## Experiments
The code for model implementation and experiments carried out are available in `Transfer_Learning.ipynb`
